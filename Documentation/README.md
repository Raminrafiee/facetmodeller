There are three files here:

"facetmodeller_softwarex_preprint.pdf"
- A preprint of a published article in SoftwareX regarding the FacetModeller software.

"facetmodeller_initial_submission.pdf"
- An earlier submission to a different journal before switching to SoftwareX.
- This is a more detailed manuscript and shows more of the processing for the examples in the SoftwareX article.

"facetmodeller_tutorials.pdf"
- Contains various tutorials.

The documentation file "facetmodeller_tutorials.pdf" is quite old. The tutorials within it were designed and written using an older version of FacetModeller. Not only will the screenshots look different, some instructions may be obsolete, e.g. menu items may have changed or moved. Furthermore, the model building approaches that are most efficient for the described tutorials may have changed given the new functionality in the most up-to-date version of FacetModeller. Finally, the document is part of a larger document and therefore there may be some missing links. I will, when I find time, update the documentation and tutorials for the current version of FacetModeller. Please contact me if you have any problems.
